## Clean character strings:

`trim()` will remove whitespace from either the left side of a character string, right side of a character string, or both sides.



Usage: `trim(" A string ", side = "left")`



`substrRight()` provides a wrapper for `substr()` where it will take a substring indexing at the right side of a character string.

Usage: `substrRight("12March2014", n = 4)`



## Dealing with factors:

`applyLabels()` is a wrapper for `factor()` which will apply a common label to one or more variables in `data.frame`.

Usage: `applyLabels(data = df, varlist = c("var1", "var2"), labels = c("No", "Yes"))`



`reFactor()` reorders the ordering of the levels of a factor variable. If the order is not given, the factor levels are reverse-ordered.

Usage: `reFactor(x, index_order = c(3, 1, 2))`


## Expanding and Collapsing Data:

`dichot()` converts a vector to `0` and `1`s, converting all data in matching `group1` to `0` and all data matching `group2` to `1`, with all other data being set to `NA`

Usage: `dichot(x, group1=c("No", "no"), group2=c("Yes", "yes"))`


`dummyCode()` creates a standard set of variables dummy coded based on a input vector.

Usage: `dummyCode(x)`

`dropAllNA()` will drop all columns, rows, or both, where all entries in the data.frame are NA.

Usage: `dropAllNA(df)`


`multChoiceCondense()` takes a set of variables in a dataset and collapses them into a single variable.

Usage: `multChoiceCondense(data = df, varList = c())`



## Other data cleaning methods:

`logical_join()` provides booliean variable appended onto data1, indicating which rows have matching observations in data2

Usage: `logical_join(df1, df2, by =)`
       `df1 %>% logical_join(df2, by =)`


`normalize()` normalize transforms a numeric vector to percentile ranks

Usage: `normalize(x)`


`rmOutliers()` converts outleirs (as defined as being some x number of standard deviations from the mean) to either NA, mean +/- x standard deviations, or the mean. 

Usage: `rmOutliers(x, sdCut = 3, method = "remove")`


`t_()` is an expansion of the t() function, in which, if x is a data.frame(), it is transposed, and the first column of the output data.frame is the column names from the input data.frame.

Usage: `t_(x)`
